## What about Notion?

~~Might go side by side.~~

Might use it for some public datesheet or something. Notion might not a first-chioce for a blog considering lack of support of full customizability or animation that CSS/JS can apply.

## So... Where's stuff? For all this time?

There's two problem.

A, I have no understanding of Jekyll - which is the easier way - and am not fully skilled for HTML/CSS/JS - the harder way. That cause problems in terms of actual deploy to GitHub Pages (I can't publish a half-baked site. Not again.)

And there's the problem of not used to Linux, causing problem when deploy Jeklly locally for testing.

B, I actually have no solid stuff to write about. I thought about writing stuff about proofreading as some kind of cautionary tales to translators, but then I realized that I've never collected my work history. Therefore I got nothing to summary. 

Even then, I didn't major in English. No matter how good I am on translate, I can't explain anything with any kind of language theories. I didn't even learn English grammar, don't have any ideas on basic elements of languages, let alone the serious problem that "A Chinese native speaker" imply: skillful at using, useless when explaining why.

Somewhat fortunately, NixieSub do have all translated documents online, possibly with version history, so considering materials, I do have things to write on. But on language/literature side of things, that's the Rome that can't be done overnight.

I'll try my best. At least I know I might have two things to write about: *Why Translate is Not a Trivial Stuff That Everyone Can Take On* (Base on NixieSub's application translations) and some interesting translation things I found in day to day proofreading.

Oh right, and the project to move nixiesubs.com onto GitHub Pages.

There's a lot to do, then.
