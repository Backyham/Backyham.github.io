# Blog

Once again, a blog. Hopefully this one will last longer.

This is Nick Lian's Blog, serving as the collection of his photography & videography, diary-like articles, and Chinese translations of foreign articles he intersted in.

Published via GitHub Pages on domain ```nicklian.cn```.

## What about Notion?

Might go side by side.
